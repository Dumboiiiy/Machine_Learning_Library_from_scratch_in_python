# Machine Learning Models from Scratch

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models from scratch. Instead of relying on high-level libraries such as Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, I have implemented these algorithms using core Python and NumPy. The purpose is to understand the underlying mathematics and logic behind these models.

## Models Implemented (Planned)
1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
2. **Linear Regression** âœ… *(Currently Implemented)*
3. **Logistic Regression**
4. **Regression Refactoring**
5. **Naive Bayes**
6. **Perceptron**
7. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
8. **Decision Tree**
9. **Random Forest**
10. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
11. **K-Means Clustering**
12. **AdaBoost**
13. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
14. **Neural Networks from Scratch**
15. **Load Data From CSV** (Various methods using Python and NumPy rather than fetching from Scikit-Learn)

## Structure of Each Model
For every model implemented in this repository, I will include:
- **Mathematical Foundations**: Explanation of the formulas, derivations, and intuition behind the algorithm.
- **Implementation Process**: Step-by-step breakdown of how the algorithm is built.
- **Thought Process Behind Scratch Implementation**: Why each approach was chosen and what challenges were faced.

## Why Build ML Models from Scratch?
While using high-level libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-Learn is essential for production and real-world applications, implementing models from scratch provides deeper insights into how they work under the hood. Some key advantages include:
- **Better Understanding**: Reinforces theoretical concepts by translating them into code.
- **Customization**: Provides full control over hyperparameters, optimizations, and internal workings.
- **Debugging Skills**: Helps in understanding errors and improving debugging techniques.
- **Foundation for Research**: Necessary for advancing and modifying existing algorithms in academia or industry.

## Updates
Currently, only **Linear Regression** has been implemented. More models will be added gradually. Stay tuned!
